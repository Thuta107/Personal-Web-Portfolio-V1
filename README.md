# **Personal Web Portfolio V1**
Hello! This is my first-ever version of my Software Developer Portfolio built using basic HTML, CSS & Vanilla JavaScript. The porfolio is devloped with the aim of showcasing my personal projects and skill sets to whomever of interest in my professional profile. Additionally, this serves as a personal project of my own and hoping to update accordingly (preferably as a new version/repo) in the future iterations.
